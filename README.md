### CHALLENGE
Build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to deliver the Boris Bike System.  
### APPROACH  
This was our first challenge set by Makers Academy, we did pair programming and swapped pairs daily. My commits are split across a few different repositories for this reason. This Repo contains work from days 4 & 5.
