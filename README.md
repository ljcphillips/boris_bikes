### CHALLENGE
Build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to deliver the Boris Bike System.  

This was our first challenge set by Makers Academy, we did pair programming and swapped pairs daily. My commits are split across a few different repositories for this reason. This Repo contains work from Days 4 & 5. See the other repos below.

[Day 2](https://github.com/shihhanwang/Boris_Bikes)  
[Day 3](https://github.com/marwiz108/boris-bikes3)  

### APPROACH  
We started off by initializing our git repository with a README, writing some user stories and a mocking up a domain model. Next we set up our environment using Bundler. We used RSpec as our testing framework and used a TDD approach to add features to our project. This was our first foray into object-oriented programming.

### TESTING   
We used the RSpec testing framework to TDD this project. To test this in your local environemt, simply clone this repo and run bundle install from within the project directory.
